Gerbtris is the Tetris game witten in bash.
Why have I done this? Why not? :P
This is very basic as you can imagine. There are flaws.
For example holding a key down may print it on the playing field.
And each keypress activates the "move down" gravity function along with the movement.
And it only rotates clockwise, I couldn't be bothered to do 
anti-clockwise too even though it would be really easy to do.
And the scoring is constant - 10 points per line.

Controls:
  z     | left arrow key  : Move shape left
  x     | right arrow key : Move shape right
  SPACE | up arrow key    : Rotate shape clockwise
  m     | down arrow key  : Move shape down 
  q                       : Quit game

Thanks and resources used:

This is a brilliant resource written by Ngoc (Alex) Vuong (@Dragonzal) that perfectly explains how to programatically rotate an array.
This is awesome! Thank you for writing this.

Also thanks to my good friend and colleague @csBlueChip for the awesome idea of getting the program to beep whenever a line is made. 
I salute you sir!

Enjoy the game.
